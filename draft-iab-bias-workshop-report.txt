1.  Introduction

   The Internet as part of the critical infrastructure affects many
   aspects of our society significantly, although it impacts different
   parts of society differently.  The Internet is an important tool to
   reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) [SDG] and to globally
   support human rights.  Consequently, the lack of meaningful access to
   digital infrastructure and services is also a form of
   disenfranchisement.

   Solely having Internet access is not enough.  At the same time as we
   work to connect the next billion people and reduce the digital
   divide, it is also important to understand persistent and novel
   inequalities in the digital age when accessing content and services.
   There are more and more barriers to meaningful access to the services
   and applications that run on the Internet.  Even if Internet
   connectivity is available, information and services access may remain
   challenged and unequal.

   This IAB workshop has aimed

   *  to collect reports about barriers to accessing content and
      services on the Internet, e.g. based on filtering, and blocking as
      well as due to general inequality of technological capabilities,
      like device or protocol limitations.

   *  to help the Internet community get a better understanding of how
      the Internet functions in different parts of the world and which
      technology or techniques need to be used to gain access to
      content.

   *  to build an understanding of what “being connected” to the
      Internet means: What is the Internet to users?  What is needed to
      be meaningfully connected?  What are the minimum requirements to
      be able to access certain parts of the content and services
      provided over the Internet?

2.  Workshop Scope and Discussion

   The workshop was organized across three days with all-group
   discussion slots, one per day.  The following topic areas were
   identified and the program committee organized paper submissions into
   three main themes for each of the three discussion slots.  During
   each discussion, those papers were presented sequentially with open
   discussion held at the end of each day.

2.1.  Session 1: Community Networks - Their Role in Internet Access of
      Services

   The first day of the workshop focused on the role of Community
   Networks [RFC7962] as a way to overcome the barriers to Internet
   Access.  Community Networks are self-organized networks wholly owned
   by the community and thus provide an alternative mechanism to bring
   connectivity and internet services to those places that lack
   commercial interest.

   Presentations ranged from highlighting the need for measuring Quality
   of Experience (QoE) for Community Networks, to the potential role the
   Content Delivery Network (CDN) can play in Community Networks, to the
   role of Satellite Networks, and finally, to the vital role of the
   spectrum in this space.

   TODO Session 2

2.3.  Session 3: Censorship - Measurements

   This session focused on reports of censorship as observed during
   recent years in different parts of the world, as well as on the use
   of and expectation on censorship circumvention tools, mainly use of
   secure VPN services.

   The censorship reports, with a focus on Asia, and specifically India,
   as well as Russia, as an example where censorship changes
   significantly recently, discussed the legal frameworks and court acts
   that put legal obligation on regional network providers to block
   traffic.  Further, measurements to validate the blocking as well as
   analyses how blocking is implemented was discussed, i.e. which
   protocols are used but also which kind of devices are used to
   configure the blocking rules and where are they deployed.

   [SAMSUDIN] reported on confirmed blocking form 10 countries
   (Cambodia, Hong Kong (China), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,
   Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Vietnam) in the period from 1
   July 2022 to 30 June 2023.  The blocking was either confirmed by OONI
   measurements for existing blocking fingerprints, heuristics i.e. for
   new blocking fingerprints as well as news reports of blocking orders
   or user experiences.  Most of these countries block specific contents
   such as porn, gambling, or certain news pages.  Interesting the block
   in Hong Kong and Myanmar is focused on military and governmental page
   of foreign countries.  Blocking often realized by either DNS
   tampering or HTTP tampering.  For DNS, either a decided IP address, a
   Bogon IP address (127.0.0.1) or an empty domain (nxdomain) is used.
   In case DNS tampering using a decided IP address or HTTP tampering
   some countries provide block page that exposed the blocking, however,
   more transparency about blocking applied to requested by civil
   society organisations and the iMAP project.

   [GROVER] further focused the discussion on online censorship in
   India, Pakistan and Indonesia.  In India, where providers are
   responsible to implement the blocking but no method is mandated, the
   six mayor ISPs (covering 98.82% of all subscribers) were tested on
   4379 blocked websites (based on courts orders, user reports, and
   publicly available or leaked government orders) on DNS poisoning/
   injection or HTTP/SNI-based censorship.  Used censorship techniques
   and websites blocked were different between ISPs.  Only one ISP used
   SNI-based blocking.  Multiple ISPs used two different technqiues
   (depending on the website), and all but one provide censorship
   notices.  Providers blocked between 1892 to 3721 (of 4379) pages with
   only 1115 (27.64%) of pages blocked by all ISPs.  In constract, e.g.
   in Parkistan the government can also order the IPSs to perform
   blocking, and blocking as even been observed in the past on IXP
   level, however, since 2020 there is also a central Web Monitoring
   System deployed.  In Indonesia initially the government provided
   guidance to ISP, however, the regulation was updated in 2020 and now
   allows Indonesian ISPs to block websites on their own discretion.
   But there was also in 2022 a proposal to centralise DNS.  In
   Indonesia the block is is publicly available but without any
   indication why something is blocked.

   [BASSO] reported that for Russia a high increase in additions to the
   Roskomnadzor’s block list was observed in March 2022 as well as in
   December 2022, formost covering news pages but also cover human
   rights organisation and social media, where more than 3500 blocking
   order are added to a list by an "Unknown body".  Further blocking of
   domain that are not in the official Roskomnadzor’s list have been
   observed as well.

   An invited talk presented the work in [WANG] on locating censorship
   devices by using HTTP and TLS traceroutes, identifying device vendors
   through fingerprinting, and reverse-engineering censorship triggers
   by use of fuzzing.  E.g. for the case of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan
   they showed that a significant portion of measurements from remote
   countries are blocked at the endpoint, indicating local policies but
   connection resets are also happening in Belarus and Russia.  Further
   they could identify a set of commercial network devices (firewalls)
   that are used in these countries for censorship and show how fuzzing
   can be used to fingerprint and cluster behaviors as well as
   potentially circumvents the deployed methods.

   All speakers called for more transparency by requiring blocking
   messages as well as publication and auditing of blocklists.
   Potentially even standardization could help.

   Further on in the session, the possibility and prevalence for using
   VPNs for circumvention has been discussed including user expectation
   and an analysis of security short-comings of commercial VPN services.
   The analysis presented in [RAMESH] has shown various problems that
   lead to data leaks such leakage of IPv6 traffic, non-browser traffic
   or at tunnel failure, not upholding user expectations especially when
   used in authoritarian regimes for censorship circumvention or private
   communication.

   The question how common the use of VPNs for circumvention is and its
   legal implications, as VPNs are illegal in a few countries, as been
   discussed.  E.g.  VPNs not officially banded in India but VPN
   providers need to store log data and those who haven’t complied
   stopped serving India.  However, more data on VPN use might be
   needed.

   After all, there is a cat and mouse game between censors and
   circumvents, however continued work on protocol enhancements that
   protect user privacy is essential.

Appendix A.  Position Papers

   19 position papers were submitted to the workshop call for papers. 11
   were selected for publication.  Paper that were not published either
   (2) only provided a very prelimited analysis of an idea that was felt
   to incomphrehensive for discussion at the workshop, or address
   problem that were beyond the scope as dedciated for the workshop
   discussion by e.g. discussing cyber security threads as a barrier for
   participation or implication of technology in regulation that impose
   blocking.  Both of these topics pose a potential severe risk on the
   open Internet, however, these risks might provide a high risk for all
   Interent users but do not nessearily imply an unbalance.
