Abstract

   papers, the workshop covered three areas of interest: the role of
   community networks to Internet Access of Services; reports and
   comments on the observed digital divide; and measurements of
   censorship and censorship circumvention.  This report summarizes the
   workshop's discussion and serves a reference for reports on the
   current barries to Internet Access.
