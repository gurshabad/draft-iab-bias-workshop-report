   IAB Barriers to Internet Access of Services (BIAS) Workshop Report
                 draft-iab-bias-workshop-report-latest

Abstract

   The “Barriers for Internet Access of Services (Bias)” workshop was
   convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from January 15-17,
   2024 as a three-day online meeting.  Based on the submitted position
   papers, the workshop covered three areas of interest: the role of
   community networks in Internet Access of Services; reports and
   comments on the observed digital divide; and measurements of
   censorship and censorship circumvention.  This report summarizes the
   workshop's discussion and serves as a reference for reports on the
   current barriers to Internet Access.

   Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the
   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report were
   expressed during the workshop by participants and do not necessarily
   reflect IAB's views and positions.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet as part of the critical infrastructure affects many
   aspects of our society significantly, although it impacts different
   parts of society differently.  The Internet is an important tool to
   reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) [SDG] and to globally
   support human rights.  Consequently, the lack of meaningful access to
   digital infrastructure and services is also a form of
   disenfranchisement.

   Solely having Internet access is not enough.  At the same time as we
   work to connect the next billion people and reduce the digital
   divide, it is also important to understand persistent and novel
   inequalities in the digital age when accessing content and services.
   There are more and more barriers to meaningful access to the services
   and applications that run on the Internet.  Even if Internet
   connectivity is available, information and services access may remain
   challenged and unequal.

   This IAB workshop has aimed

   *  to collect reports about barriers to accessing content and
      services on the Internet, e.g. based on filtering, and blocking as
      well as due to general inequality of technological capabilities,
      like device or protocol limitations.

   *  to help the Internet community get a better understanding of how
      the Internet functions in different parts of the world and which
      technology or techniques need to be used to gain access to
      content.

   *  to build an understanding of what “being connected” to the
      Internet means: What is the Internet to users?  What is needed to
      be meaningfully connected?  What are the minimum requirements to
      be able to access certain parts of the content and services
      provided over the Internet?

   attempt to capture a consensus.

2.  Workshop Scope and Discussion

   The workshop was organized across three days with all-group
   discussion slots, one per day.  The following topic areas were
   identified and the program committee organized paper submissions into
   three main themes for each of the three discussion slots.  During
   each discussion, those papers were presented sequentially with open
   discussion held at the end of each day.

2.1.  Session 1: Community Networks - Their Role in Internet Access of
      Services

   The first day of the workshop focused on the role of Community
   Networks [RFC7962] as a way to overcome the barriers to Internet
   Access.  Community Networks are self-organized networks wholly owned
   by the community and thus provide an alternative mechanism to bring
   connectivity and internet services to those places that lack
   commercial interest.

   Presentations ranged from highlighting the need for measuring Quality
   of Experience (QoE) for Community Networks, to the potential role the
   Content Delivery Network (CDN) can play in Community Networks, to the
   role of Satellite Networks, and finally, to the vital role of the
   spectrum in this space.

2.1.5.  Discussion

2.2.  Session 2: Digital Divide - Reports and Comments

   TODO Session 2

2.3.  Session 3: Censorship - Measurements

   This session focused on reports of censorship as observed during
   recent years in different parts of the world, as well as on the use
   of and expectation on censorship circumvention tools, mainly use of
   secure VPN services.

   The censorship reports, with a focus on Asia, and specifically India,
   as well as Russia, as an example where censorship changes
   significantly recently, discussed the legal frameworks and court acts
   that put legal obligation on regional network providers to block
   traffic and also measurements to validate the blocking as well as
   analyses how blocking is implemented, i.e. which protocols are used
   but also which kind of devices are used to configure the blocking
   rules and where are they deployed.

   Further, the possibility and prevalence for using VPNs for
   circumvention has been discussed including user expectation and an
   analysis of security short-comings of commercial VPN services.  This
   analysis has shown various problems that lead to data leaks, not
   upholding user expectations especially when used in authoritarian
   regimes for censorship circumvention or private communication.

Appendix A.  Position Papers

   19 position papers were submitted to the workshop call for papers. 11
   were selected for publication.  Paper that were not published either
   (2) only provided a very prelimited analysis of an idea that was felt
   to incomphrehensive for discussion at the workshop, or address
   problem that were beyond the scope as dedciated for the workshop
   discussion by e.g. discussing cyber security threads as a barrier for
   participation or implication of technology in regulation that impose
   blocking.  Both of these topics pose a potential severe risk on the
   open Internet, however, these risks might provide a high risk for all
   Interent users but do not nessearily imply an unbalance.
